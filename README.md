This is a Next.js project that uses a PostgreSQL database to manage to-do items. This README provides instructions on how to set up the project locally and connect it to a PostgreSQL database.

## Technical Audience

This README is intended for technical users who are familiar with Node.js, PostgreSQL, and the command line interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you will need the following installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. In the terminal, run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the project dependencies.
